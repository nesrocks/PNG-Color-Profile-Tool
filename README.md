# PNG-Color-Profile-Tool
Checks for iCCP chunks from all PNG files in a folder.
If any PNG with a iCCP chunk is found, a fixed files folder is created and all files are copied into it, with fixed versions of the problematic PNGs.

This tool is written in GML.
GameMaker version 2.3 was used.

Only tested on Windows but may be adapted and compiled into other platforms if a proper license is used.
